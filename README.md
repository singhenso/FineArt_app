#Synopsis

FineArt app is a way for people to be able to stay current with the current fine art world.
They would be able to see the most current galleries in specific regions.  Such as LA, San Francisco, New York and other fine art galleries in Europe. Users will be able to add posts through Facebook and share with their freinds. These users would be Gallerie owners who would like to showcase their artists and artwork.

#Summary

Gallery App is a way for artist and clients to communicate what is goin on in the fine art world and be able to keep track with what is goin on in the Art world. This would be a similar website like modemayem.com but for visual artist.

#Stretch Goals
Create an interactive website for Visual Artist to communicate and check out Galleries around the world.
